# Internship-ML-Algorithms

These are some ML scripts that I worked with during my internship with [Evangelia Drakopoulou](https://github.com/edrakopo) at the ANNIE experiment that do the track length and energy reconstruction. In this branch I have also included files that use the lime package to try and explain the predictions of the DNN and the BDT we use. For more info on the code of the package check [lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) and for more information on the theory check the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938).
